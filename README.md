👋 Hi, I’m Sarika Kumar

🎓 Education

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science, which provided me with a strong technical foundation. Over time, my career journey in e-commerce and client management sparked my interest in data-driven decision-making, motivating me to transition into the field of Data Analytics.

💼 Experience

My professional journey began as an E-commerce Executive, where I managed multiple seller accounts across platforms like Amazon, Flipkart etc. I was responsible for account management, inventory tracking, reporting, client communication, and leading junior team members to ensure smooth operations.

This experience not only strengthened my organizational and reporting skills but also made me realize the power of data in business strategy and decision-making. This inspired me to upskill in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python for Data Analysis to transition into a Data Analyst role.

🚀 My Current Endeavours

I am currently on a focused journey to transition into Data Analytics, building expertise in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python for Data Analysis.

My hands-on practice involves working with real-world datasets—cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to uncover insights. Recently, I created projects where I applied SQL for database management, designed interactive dashboards in Power BI, and used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for exploratory data analysis.

My ability to connect business requirements from my e-commerce experience with data-driven solutions helps me create actionable insights that support smarter decision-making.
